# Dexy - Documentation Java - PoC

A few tests with [Dexy](http://dexy.it).

## Objectives

A few things I want to be able to perform:

  * Embed Java code with syntax highlighting
  * Display an image
  * Output as HTML and PDF
  * Templates (header/footer)

## Improvements

What needs to be worked out:

  * Tables of content. There is [DocToc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc). Anything with Dexy?
  * Syntax highlight for code embedded in Markdown files.
 
## Requirements

  * Python 2.x
  * Dexy
  * LaTeX compiler

## Generate documentation

Run the following commands:

    dexy setup
    dexy

You can see the result here:
